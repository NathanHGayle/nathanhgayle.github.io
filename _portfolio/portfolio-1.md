## Findings

Gambling premises are positioned near those who have:
           + Never worked, faced long-term unemployed.
           + Engaged in full-time education. 
           + More at risk of local criminal victimisation (Crime).
           + Experiencing income deprivation (Income)'
           + Involuntarily excluded from the labour market (Employment).
           + More at risk of premature death and impairment of quality of life through poor physical or mental health                     (Health).

## How we know
It was discovered that as gambling premises increase, the percentage of individuals grouped as 'Never Worked / Long-Term Unemployment' by national socio-economic class (NSEC) increase. Conversely, as the percentage of individuals grouped as 'Intermediate Occupations' and 'Managerial, Administrative, and Professional Occupations' by NSEC decreases. 
    Also, as gambling premises increase, the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD 2019) Rank decreases - where 1 represents the most deprived areas. This is particularly true for 'Crime', 'Income', Employment' and 'Health' but also for domains 'Education, Skills and Training' and 'Living Environment'.

## Methodology 
This was achieved by examining the correlations between 'Total Gambling Premisies', 'National Socio-Economic Class' groups and the 'Indices of Deprivation (IMD 2019)' groups by Constituency. This statistical evidence corroborates the relationships that are readily discernible when visualized on scatter-plot charts (refer to pages 2-4 in the dashboard).
