The purpose of this site to is to share the analytics projects I'm most passionate about! Delving into publicly available data and drawing insights is surprisingly fun! On a quest to find some answers, one question at a time. 

Check out a recent project answering the question "How do gambling premises relate to socio-economic class and deprivation in the UK" 
------
Observing how many gambling premises there were in my area and surrounding areas, I was keen to find out just how these places were permitted to be so clustered! This led me designing a dashboard for local communities to reference in conversations with their local councils by detailing an overview of operation gambling premises in their area, and inform them on the correlation of gambling premises to deprivation and socio-economic class. It's an obvious one, correlatiation is not causation so it's aimed at being insightful, inspiring conversations - though it's nothing new - and providing evidence around what I myself had observed in my local area.
